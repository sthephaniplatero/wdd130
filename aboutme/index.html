    <p> Hello everyone! I'm glad to be part of this group and share with 
        you this opportunity to learn . I'm from San Salvador ,El Salvador a tropical and beatiful
        city in Central America.
        
    </p>

    <p>I really enjoy running, cooking, reading but especially outdoor activities, visit different places
       like beaches, volcanoes, forest and small towns in my country with my family and friends is what I 
       enjoy the most.

        At this moment I'm single but I really love spending time with my family, we are so close
        and funny. I'm enjoying serving in my calling as a counselor in my primary ward , and as
        Temple and Family History Consultant, the temple is an important part in my life and is a huge
        blessing for me to serve there.

        One of my biggest dream always was to be part of this university to improve my education
        and increase my testimony as the same time , is kind a miracle for me because I thouht I never would have an opportunity
        to obtain a bachelor's degree in technology but this for me is a second chance to study what I really always wanted to study.
        I feel technology has been a huge advantage in my life to obtain knowledge and learn new thing no matter
        where we are , I try every day to take advantage and enjoy this blessing in my life!
        
        I hope we can enjoy this semester and share our learning experiences in this course!
    </p>
